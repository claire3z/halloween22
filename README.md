## Fun Project for Halloween 2022
The idea is to play a spooky sound automatically when trick-or-treaters come to door/gate.

Hardware:
- Old phone with camera
- Wireless bluetooth speaker
- PC with wifi connection

Sequence of Event:
1. When children enters the surveillance area, a greeting message is played warning them not to move.
2. Any subsequent motion is detected and triggers the program to play a spooky Halloween-themed sound.
3. After 30 sec, ask for password to enter the gate and allow entrance.
4. Program put to sleep for 3 min after each encounter before looping back to detect the next motion event.

Things to improve:
 - Interactivity through an outdoor mic - audio processing TBD
 - Projecting b/w motion images of the 'trick-or-treaters' on garage door - to buy a portable projector
 - Trigger-controlled LED lights for visual effects
